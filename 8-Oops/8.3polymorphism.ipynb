    "What is Polymorphism in Python?\n",
    "Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). It refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or operation in their unique way.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "The same method name can behave differently depending on the object calling it.\n",
    "In Python, polymorphism is typically implemented through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in a base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation Using the Example\n",
    "In your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism in Action:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shape class defines a generic area method.\n",
    "The Rectangle and Circle subclasses override the area method to provide their own implementation.\n",
    "A single function, print_area, can work with any shape object, calling the appropriate area method for that object.\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "When print_area(rect) is called, Python resolves the area() method for the Rectangle class and calculates width * height.\n",
    "Similarly, when print_area(circl) is called, Python resolves the area() method for the Circle class and calculates π * radius².\n",
    "Why use Polymorphism? Without polymorphism, you would need to write separate functions for each type of shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "def print_rectangle_area(rectangle):\n",
    "    print(f\"Area is {rectangle.width * rectangle.height}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_circle_area(circle):\n",
    "    print(f\"Area is {3.14 * circle.radius**2}\")\n",
    "This approach is less flexible and harder to maintain. By using polymorphism, you write a single function (print_area) that works for all shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points to Emphasize in an Interview\n",
    "Unified Interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different classes as objects of a common base class.\n",
    "In this example, Rectangle and Circle are treated as Shape.\n",
    "Simplified Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "One function (print_area) can handle different types of objects without requiring separate functions.\n",
    "Extensibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a new shape (e.g., Triangle) is added, you only need to define its area method in the class. The print_area function will still work without any modifications."
